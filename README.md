# Final Capstone Project for Meta Front-End course

This mockup website has been developped with React + Vite.

## Getting Started

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

### `npm install`

Installs the necessary dependencies from the `package.json` file, setting up everything you need to run the app smoothly.

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Once started, you can view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in watch mode, making it easy to see test results in real-time.\
Our tests cover all critical components, ensuring the app is stable and performs as expected.

### PLEASE be aware that :
- I used Tailwind for handling CSS so whenever you see className="" in an element, that's Tailwind handling CSS !
- The site is responsive but ONLY for MOBILE, SMALL and MEDIUM devices : the site won't be properly scaling for large computer screens ! (you can use your web navigator - inspect feature and play with the width of the page)

### Happy review !
